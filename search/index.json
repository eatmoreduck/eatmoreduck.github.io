[{"content":"摘抄自 https://x.com/thedankoe/status/2010751592346030461 使用沉浸式翻译插件翻译，2026伊始，收藏，学习，自用\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you think new years resolutions are stupid.\n如果你和我一样，你就会觉得新年决心很愚蠢。\nBecause most people go about changing their lives in the completely wrong way. They create these resolutions because everyone else does – we create a superficial meaning out of status games – but they don’t meet the requirements for true change, which goes a lot deeper than convincing yourself you’re going to be more disciplined or productive this year.\n因为大多数人改变生活的方式完全错误。他们制定这些计划只是因为其他人都这么做——我们把这种追求地位的游戏赋予了肤浅的意义——但这些计划并不符合真正改变的要求，真正的改变远比说服自己今年会更加自律或高效要深刻得多。\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re one of these people, I\u0026rsquo;m not here to talk down on you (I tend to be a bit harsh in my writing). I’ve quit 10x more goals than I’ve achieved. I think that should be the case for most people. But the fact that people try to change their lives and utterly fail almost every time holds true.\n如果你属于这类人，我并非有意贬低你（我的文笔有时确实比较尖锐）。我放弃的目标比实现的要多十倍。我想大多数人都是如此。但人们尝试改变生活却几乎每次都以彻底失败告终，这的确是事实。\nHowever, as much as I think new years resolutions are stupid, it’s always wise to reflect on the life you hate so you can launch yourself toward something that much better, as we will discuss.\n然而，尽管我认为新年决心很愚蠢，但反思自己讨厌的生活总是明智的，这样你才能朝着更好的方向前进，我们将在下文中讨论这一点。\nSo whether you want to start the business, transform your body, or take the risk toward a more meaningful life without quitting after 2 weeks, I want to share 7 ideas you probably haven’t heard before on behavior change, psychology, and productivity so you can do just that in 2026.\n所以，无论你是想创业、改变体型，还是想冒险追求更有意义的生活而不至于两周后就放弃，我都想分享 7 个你可能从未听说过的关于行为改变、心理学和生产力的想法，以便你在 2026 年能够做到这一点。\nThis will be comprehensive.\n这将是一项全面的工作。\nThis isn’t one of those letters that you read through and forget about.\n这不是那种读一遍就忘的信。\nThis is something you will want to bookmark, take notes on, and set aside time to think about.\n这是你需要收藏、记笔记并留出时间思考的内容。\nThe protocol at the end (to dig deep into your psyche and uncover what you truly want in life) will take about a full day to complete, with effects that last far longer than that.\n最后一步（深入挖掘你的内心世界，发现你真正想要的生活）大约需要一整天的时间才能完成，其效果持续时间要长得多。\nLet’s begin.\n我们开始吧。\nI – You aren’t where you want to be because you aren’t the person who would be there\n我——你之所以没能到达你想去的地方，是因为你不是那个会待在那里的人。\nWhen it comes to setting big goals, people tend to focus on one of the two requirements for success:\n在设定远大目标时，人们往往会关注成功的两个必要条件之一：\nChanging your actions to make progress toward the goal (least important, second order)\n改变你的行动以朝着目标取得进展（最不重要，次要因素）\nChanging who you are so that your behavior naturally follows (most important, first order)\n改变你的本质，让你的行为自然而然地随之改变（最重要，首要步骤）\nMost people set a surface-level goal, hype themselves up to remain disciplined for the first few weeks, then go back to their old ways without much struggle, because they were trying to build a great life on a rotting foundation.\n大多数人设定一个肤浅的目标，给自己打气，让自己在前几周保持自律，然后就毫不费力地回到老样子，因为他们试图在一个腐朽的根基上建立美好的生活。\nIf this doesn’t make sense, let’s run through an example.\n如果这还不够清楚，我们来看一个例子。\nThink of somebody successful. It can be a bodybuilder with a great physique, a founder/CEO worth hundreds of millions, or a charismatic dude who can chat up a group without a shred of anxiety entering his mind.\n想想那些成功人士。他可以是身材健硕的健美运动员，身价数亿美元的创始人/CEO，也可以是魅力四射、能与一群人侃侃而谈而丝毫不会感到焦虑的人。\nDo you think the bodybuilder has to “grind” to eat healthy? Does the CEO have to discipline themselves to show up and lead the team? To you, it may seem like that on the surface, but the truth is that they can’t see themselves living any other way. The bodybuilder has to grind to eat unhealthily. The CEO has to force themself to lie in bed past their alarm clock, and they hate every second of it (there is nuance here, just entertain me for a second).\n你觉得健美运动员必须“拼命”才能吃得健康吗？CEO 必须自律才能按时到岗领导团队吗？表面上看似乎如此，但事实是他们无法想象自己过其他的生活。 健美运动员必须拼命才能吃得不健康 。CEO 必须强迫自己赖床超过闹钟，而且他们讨厌其中的每一秒（这里面有很多细微差别，请允许我解释一下）。\nTo some people, my own lifestyle seems a bit extreme and disciplined. To me, it’s natural, and I don’t say that to contrast it with any other kind of lifestyle. I simply enjoy living this way. When my mom tells me that I should take a break, go out, and have some fun\u0026hellip; I hold my tongue from telling her, “If I weren’t having fun, why would I be doing what I’m doing?”\n有些人觉得我的生活方式有点极端，也太自律了。对我来说，这很自然，我这么说并不是要把它和其他生活方式对立起来。我只是单纯地享受这种生活。当妈妈劝我休息一下，出去玩玩的时候……我忍住没跟她说：“如果我不觉得开心，那我干嘛还要做这些？”\nThis next sentence may sound simple, but it is baffling how many people don\u0026rsquo;t get it.\n接下来这句话听起来很简单，但令人费解的是，竟然有那么多人不明白。\nIf you want a specific outcome in life, you must have the lifestyle that creates that outcome long before you reach it.\n如果你想在生活中取得某种特定的成果，你必须在实现该成果之前很久就拥有能够创造该成果的生活方式 。\nIf someone says they want to lose 30 pounds, I often don’t believe them. Not because I don’t think they are capable, but because there are too many times when that same person says, “I can’t wait until I\u0026rsquo;m done losing weight so I can start to enjoy life again.” I hate to break it to you, but if you don’t adopt the lifestyle that led to you losing the weight, for life, and find a reason with a higher gravitational pull than the one tying you to your previous ways, then you will go straight back to where you started, and you can unhappily say that you wasted the resource you will never get back: time.\n如果有人说他们想减掉 30 磅，我通常不太相信。不是因为我觉得他们不行，而是因为太多时候，这些人会说：“我迫不及待地想减掉体重，这样我就可以重新享受生活了。” 我不得不告诉你，如果你不能把让你减肥的生活方式坚持下去，并且找到一个比让你继续旧习惯更有吸引力的理由 ，那么你最终会回到原点，而且你会遗憾地承认，你浪费了永远无法挽回的资源：时间。\nWhen you truly change yourself, all of your habits that don’t move the needle toward your goal become disgusting, because you have a deep and profound awareness of what kind of life those actions compound into. You are okay with your current standards because you are not fully aware of what they are or what they lead to. We will discuss how to uncover this, but we need to build up to that.\n当你真正改变自己时，所有那些对实现目标毫无帮助的习惯都会变得令人厌恶，因为你深刻地意识到这些行为最终会把你的生活变成什么样子。你之所以对目前的生活方式感到满意，是因为你并不完全了解它们是什么，也不清楚它们会导致什么后果。我们会探讨如何揭开这些真相，但这需要循序渐进。\nYou say you want to change. You say you want to “become financially free” and “get healthy,” but your actions show otherwise for a reason. And it goes a lot deeper than you think.\n你说你想改变，你说你想“实现财务自由”和“拥有健康的身体”，但你的行动却恰恰相反，这其中必有缘由。而且，这背后的原因远比你想象的要深远。\nII – You aren’t where you want to be because you don’t want to be there\n二、你之所以没能到达你想去的地方，是因为你根本不想待在那里。\nTrust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words. Trust movement. – Alfred Adler\n只相信行动。生活发生在事件层面，而非言语层面。相信行动。 ——阿尔弗雷德·阿德勒\nIf you want to change who you are, you must understand how the mind works so that you can start to reprogram it.\n如果你想改变自己，就必须了解大脑的运作方式 ，这样才能开始重新编程它。\nThe first step to understanding the mind is to understand that all behavior is goal-oriented. It\u0026rsquo;s teleological. When you think about it, this is kinda obvious, but when we dig into it, most people don’t want to hear it.\n理解心灵的第一步是理解所有行为都是目标导向的，即目的论。仔细想想，这似乎显而易见，但当我们深入探讨时，大多数人却不愿接受。\nYou take a step forward because you want to reach a certain location.\n你向前迈一步，是因为你想到达某个地方。\nYou scratch your nose because you want to make the itch go away.\n你挠鼻子是因为你想止痒。\nThose ones are clear, but most of the time, your goals are unconscious. You may not realize that when you sit on the couch in the middle of the day, you are trying to burn time before your next responsibility, as one simple example.\n这些目标很明确，但大多数时候，你的目标是无意识的。举个简单的例子，你可能没有意识到，当你中午坐在沙发上时，你其实是在为下一个任务做准备，试图消磨时间。\nOn an even more unconscious and complex level, you pursue goals that can harm you, but you justify your actions in a way that is socially acceptable and doesn’t make you seem like a loser.\n在更深层次的无意识和复杂的层面上，你会追求可能伤害自己的目标，但你会用一种社会可接受的方式来为自己的行为辩解，这样你就不会显得自己像个失败者。\nAs an example, if you can’t stop procrastinating your work, you may justify it with the fact that you “lack discipline,” but in reality, you are attempting to achieve a goal like you always are. In this case, that goal could be to protect yourself from the judgment that comes from finishing and sharing your work.\n举例来说，如果你总是拖延工作，你可能会用“缺乏自律”来为自己辩解，但实际上，你和以往一样，都是在试图达成某个目标。在这种情况下，你的目标可能是为了避免完成并分享作品后所受到的评判。\nIf you say you want to quit your dead-end job, but stay in it without any real reason, you may start to think you don’t have enough courage, or that you were never really a “risk taker,” but the truth is that you are pursuing the goal of safety, predictability, and an excuse to not look like a failure to everyone else in your life who sees working a dead-end job as a sign of success.\n如果你说你想辞掉那份没有前途的工作，但却没有任何真正的理由继续待在那里，你可能会开始认为自己没有足够的勇气，或者你从来就不是一个“冒险者”，但事实是，你追求的是安全感、可预测性，以及一个不让自己在生活中其他人眼中显得失败的借口，因为在他们看来，从事一份没有前途的工作是成功的标志。\nThe lesson here is that real change requires changing your goals.\n这说明，真正的改变需要改变你的目标。\nI don’t mean setting some surface-level goal because the act of doing that serves an unconscious goal that is actually harming you. That’s been ran through enough in the productivity space. I mean changing your point of view. Because that’s what a goal is. A goal is a projection into the future that acts as a lens of perception which allows you to notice information, ideas, and resources that aid in you achieving that goal.\n我指的不是设定一些肤浅的目标， 因为这样做会助长一种潜意识里对你有害的欲望 。这一点在效率提升领域已经被讨论得够多了。我指的是改变你的视角。 因为目标本质上就是改变你的视角。目标是对未来的一种展望，它就像一面透镜，让你能够注意到那些有助于你实现目标的信息、想法和资源。\nNow let’s dig a bit deeper, because if you don’t understand this, it only becomes more difficult to get out.\n现在让我们深入探讨一下，因为如果你不理解这一点，只会让脱身变得更加困难。\nI send out letters like these 1-2x a week. If you don’t want to miss them,\njoin here.\nYou can also read my book free, other letters, etc.\n我每周会寄出一到两封这样的信件。如果您不想错过，\n点击这里加入。\n您还可以免费阅读我的书、其他信件等等。\nIII – You aren’t where you want to be because you’re afraid to be there\n第三点——你之所以没能到达你想去的地方，是因为你害怕到达那里。\nThe important thing for you to remember is that it does not matter in the least how you got the idea or where it came from. You may never have met a professional hypnotist. You may never have been formally hypnotized. But if you have accepted an idea - from yourself, your teachers, your parents, friends, advertisements, from any other source - and further, if you are firmly convinced that idea is true, it has the same power over you as the hypnotist’s words have over the hypnotized subject. – Maxwell Maltz\n你最需要记住的是，你如何获得这个想法或它来自哪里都无关紧要。你可能从未见过专业的催眠师，也可能从未接受过正式的催眠。但是，如果你接受了某种想法——无论是来自你自己、你的老师、你的父母、朋友、广告，还是任何其他来源——并且你坚信这个想法是正确的，那么它对你的影响就如同催眠师的话语对被催眠者的影响一样。 ——麦克斯韦·马尔茨\nHere’s how you’ve become who you are today, and how you will become who you will be tomorrow. This is the anatomy of identity:\n这就是你如何成为今天的你，以及你如何成为明天的你的原因。这就是身份的构成：\nYou want to achieve a goal\n你想实现一个目标\nYou perceive reality through the lens of that goal\n你透过那个目标的视角来看待现实。\nYou only notice “important” information and ideas that allows you to achieve that goal (learning)\n你只会注意到那些能帮助你实现学习目标的“重要”信息和想法。\nYou act toward that goal and receive feedback that you are progressing toward it\n你朝着那个目标采取行动，并收到反馈，表明你正在朝着目标前进。\nYou repeat that behavior until it becomes automatic and unconscious (conditioning)\n你重复这种行为，直到它变成自动的、无意识的（条件反射）。\nThat behavior becomes a part of who you think you are (”I am the type of person who\u0026hellip;”)\n这种行为会成为你对自己认知的一部分（“我是那种人……”）。\nYou defend your identity to maintain psychological consistency\n你捍卫自己的身份是为了维持心理一致性。\nYour identity shapes new goals, restarting the cycle, and if that identity is disadvantageous toward a good life, this gets bad very quick\n你的身份认同会塑造新的目标，从而重新开始循环；如果这种身份认同不利于美好生活，情况就会迅速恶化。\nThe unfortunate reality is that you must break the cycle between steps 6 and 7, but this process starts when you are a child.\n令人遗憾的是，你必须打破第 6 步和第 7 步之间的循环，但这个过程要从你还是个孩子的时候就开始了。\nYou have the goal of survival.\n你的目标是生存。\nYou are dependent on your parents to teach you how to survive. You had to conform. And since the way most people teach is through reward and punishment, unless you adopt their beliefs and values, you will be punished. You don’t actually think for yourself until you see through this.\n你依赖父母教你如何生存。你不得不顺从。而大多数人的教育方式是奖惩分明，所以除非你接受他们的信仰和价值观，否则你就会受到惩罚。只有当你看穿这一切，你才能真正独立思考。\nBut your parents have also gone through this process throughout their entire lives. That’s where it can get dangerous. Your parents, unless they broke the pattern themselves, were conditioned by the culturally accepted ideas of success from the Industrial age. They also carry the best and worst conditioning from their parents and their parents’ parents.\n但你的父母一生中也经历了同样的过程。这正是危险所在。除非他们自己打破了这种模式，否则他们都会受到工业时代文化中普遍接受的成功观念的影响。他们也继承了父母和祖父母身上最好和最坏的观念。\nTo take it a layer deeper, once you fulfill your physical survival needs (which is quite easy to do in today’s world, you’re practically born into safety), you start to survive on the conceptual or ideological level. You may not try to protect and reproduce your body, but you absolutely protect and reproduce your mind. It’s not difficult to see the war of ideas on the internet, and the participants are individual and group identities.\n更深入地来说，一旦你满足了生理生存需求（在当今世界这很容易做到，你几乎生来就享有安全），你便开始在概念或意识形态层面生存。你或许不会试图保护和繁衍你的身体，但你绝对会保护和繁衍你的思想。不难看出互联网上的思想之战，而参与者既有个人身份，也有群体身份。\nWhen your body feels threatened, you go into fight or flight.\n当你的身体感到受到威胁时，你会进入战斗或逃跑状态。\nWhen your identity feels threatened, the same thing happens.\n当你的身份认同受到威胁时，同样的事情也会发生。\nIf you are heavily identified with a political ideology (by the process we talked about just before), you will feel threatened when someone challenges your beliefs. You literally feel the stress. You feel, emotionally, like you were just slapped in the face. Since most people don’t analyze their emotions for truth, you tend to get stuck in echo chambers and double down on claims that harm yourself and others.\n如果你对某种政治意识形态认同过深（就像我们刚才讨论的那样），当有人挑战你的信仰时，你会感到威胁。你会真切地感受到压力，就像被人狠狠扇了一巴掌。由于大多数人不会分析自己的情绪以求真相，你往往会陷入回音室效应，并更加固执己见，最终伤害自己和他人。\nIf you were raised in a religious household, and did not think for yourself, you will fight and attack others who threaten your psychological safety within that little bubble.\n如果你在宗教家庭长大，没有独立思考的能力，那么当有人威胁到你在那个小圈子里的心理安全时，你就会攻击和反抗。\nThe same thing happens when you unconsciously see yourself as a lawyer, a gamer, or somebody else who would not take the actions to achieve a better life.\n当你无意识地将自己视为律师、游戏玩家或其他不会采取行动去追求更好生活的人时，也会发生同样的情况。\nIV – The life you want lies within a specific level of mind\n第四点——你想要的生活存在于某种特定的心智层次之中。\nThe mind evolves through predictable stages over time.\n人的思维会随着时间的推移经历可预测的阶段而发展。\nWhen you’re born, you’re like a little survival sponge that absorbs whatever beliefs you can (which are heavily dictated by your culture) so that you can feel safe and secure. And if you don’t be careful, your mind may crystalize and it may make it difficult to live a meaningful life.\n你出生时就像一块小小的求生海绵，吸收着你能接触到的一切信念（这些信念很大程度上受你的文化影响），从而获得安全感。如果你不加注意，你的思维可能会变得僵化，让你难以过上有意义的生活。\nThis has been documented enough in models like Maslow’s Hierarchy, Greuter’s stages of ego development, Spiral Dynamics, and Integral Theory, each building off of one another, but it’s also not difficult to observe in society.\n这一点在马斯洛的需求层次理论、格鲁特的自我发展阶段理论、螺旋动力学理论和整体理论等模型中都有充分的记载，这些模型彼此相互借鉴，而且在社会中也很容易观察到这一点。\nI’ve talked about these many times, and synthesized them into my own\nHuman 3.0 model\nwith various AI prompts to uncover your level of development and a path forward (open in a tab to read after if you\u0026rsquo;d like), but here’s the 80/20 of the 9 stages of ego development as a refresher (because repetition helps reveal things you didn’t notice before, and there are new people reading these letters):\n我曾多次谈到这些，并将它们综合成我自己的观点。\n人类 3.0 模型\n它会提供各种人工智能提示，帮助你了解自己的发展水平和前进方向（如果你愿意，可以在标签页中打开阅读），但这里是自我发展的九个阶段中的 80/20 部分，供你复习（因为重复有助于发现你以前没有注意到的事情，而且现在也有新的读者在阅读这些信件）：\n[\n](https://x.com/thedankoe/article/2010751592346030461/media/2010746308500631553)\nImpulsive — No separation between impulse and action. Black and white thinking. I.e. A toddler hits when angry because the feeling and the behavior are the same thing.\n冲动型 ——冲动与行动之间没有界限。非黑即白的思维模式。 例如，幼儿生气时会打人，因为在他们看来，生气的感觉和打人的行为是一回事。\nSelf-Protective — The world is dangerous and you learn to look out for yourself. I.e. A kid learns to hide report cards, lie about chores, and figure out what adults want to hear.\n自我保护 ——世界充满危险，你必须学会​​保护自己。 例如，孩子会学会藏起成绩单、谎报家务，以及琢磨大人想听什么。\nConformist — You are your group and its rules feel like reality itself. I.e. Someone who genuinely cannot fathom why anyone would vote differently than their family or group.\n墨守成规者 ——你把自己等同于你的群体，群体规则对你而言就是现实本身。 也就是说，你真的无法理解为什么有人会投票给与自己家人或群体不同的人。\nSelf-Aware — You notice you have an inner life that doesn’t match the exterior. I.e. Sitting in church and realizing you’re not sure you believe what everyone around you seems to believe, but not knowing what to do with that feeling yet.\n自我觉察 ——你发现自己的内心世界与外在表现并不一致。 例如，坐在教堂里，你意识到自己并不确定是否相信周围所有人似乎都相信的事情，但你却不知道该如何处理这种感觉。\nConscientious — You build your own system of principles and hold yourself accountable to them. I.e. Leaving your family’s religion after careful study and adopting a personal philosophy you can defend, or building a career plan with clear milestones because you believe the right effort yields the right results.\n认真负责 ——你会建立自己的一套原则体系，并严格遵守这些原则。 例如，经过仔细研究后离开家族宗教，并采纳一套自己能够捍卫的个人哲学；或者制定包含明确里程碑的职业规划，因为你相信付出正确的努力就能获得正确的结果。\nIndividualist — You see that your principles were shaped by context and start holding them more loosely. I.e. Realizing your political views have more to do with where you grew up than objective truth, or noticing that your ambitious career goals were really about earning your father’s approval.\n个人主义者 ——你意识到自己的原则是受环境影响而形成的，于是开始更加灵活地看待它们。 例如，你意识到自己的政治观点更多地与你的成长环境有关，而非客观真理；或者你发现自己雄心勃勃的职业目标实际上是为了赢得父亲的认可。\nStrategist — You work with systems while aware of your own involvement in them. I.e. Leading an organization while actively questioning your own blind spots, or engaging in politics knowing your perspective is partial and shaped by bias you can’t fully see.\n战略家 ——你运用各种系统，同时意识到自身在其中的角色。 例如，领导一个组织时，你会积极反思自身的盲点；或者参与政治活动时，你会意识到自己的视角是片面的，并且受到一些你无法完全看清的偏见的影响。\nConstruct-Aware — You see all frameworks, including your identity, as useful fictions. I.e. Holding your spiritual beliefs with metaphorically not literally, knowing the map is not the territory, or watching yourself play the role of “founder” or “thought leader” with a kind of gentle amusement.\n建构意识 ——你将所有框架，包括你的身份认同，都视为有用的虚构。 例如，你以比喻而非字面意义来持有你的精神信仰，明白地图并不等同于疆域本身，或者以一种温和的趣味看待自己扮演“创始人”或“思想领袖”的角色。\nUnitive — Separation between self and life dissolves. I.e. Work, rest, and play feel like the same thing. There’s no one left who needs to become something, just presence responding to what arises.\n合一 ——自我与生命之间的分离消融。 也就是说，工作、休息和娱乐感觉就像是同一件事。不再有需要成为某种存在的人，只有临在本身，回应着一切的发生。\nFor most people reading this, I would assume you hover between 4 and 8, which is a huge gap. Those closer to 8 are reading this are doing so to either learn something or pass time in a non-destructive way. Those closer to 4 are really looking for a change. You feel like you are meant for more, but you can’t make sense of everything yet, because there’s obviously a lot at play.\n对于大多数阅读这篇文章的人来说，我假设你们的数值介于4到8之间，这之间差距很大。数值接近8的人阅读这篇文章，要么是为了学习一些东西，要么是为了以一种无害的方式消磨时间。而数值接近4的人则真正渴望改变。你们觉得自己应该拥有更多，但你们还无法完全理解这一切，因为显然有很多因素在起作用。\nThe good thing is, it doesn’t really matter what stage you are in, because moving through any of them follows a pattern.\n好消息是，你处于哪个阶段其实并不重要，因为经历任何一个阶段都遵循一定的模式。\nV – Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of life\nV——智力是指从生活中获得你想要的东西的能力。\nThe only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life. – Naval Ravikant\n衡量智力的唯一真正标准就是你是否能实现自己的人生目标。 ——纳瓦尔·拉维坎特\nThere is a formula for success.\n成功是有秘诀的。\nOne ingredient is agency.\n其中一个要素是自主性 。\nOne ingredient is opportunity (which many people like to mistake as “privilege” - because they the other ingredients).\n其中一个要素是机会 （很多人喜欢把机会误认为是“特权”，因为他们认为机会就是其他要素）。\nThe last ingredient is intelligence.\n最后一个要素是智慧 。\nIf you have high agency but low opportunity, it doesn’t matter how likely you are to act toward a goal, because it isn’t a goal that will bear much fruit.\n如果你拥有很高的自主权但机会很少，那么你朝着目标采取行动的可能性有多大都无关紧要，因为这个目标不会带来多少成果。\nIf you have opportunity and agency but low intelligence, then you will never be fully able to benefit from that opportunity.\n如果你有机会和自主权，但智力低下，那么你永远无法充分利用这些机会。\nFirst, we’ve talked about agency before here. In terms of opportunity, I can’t tell you to change your physical location, but if you don’t see the abundance of digital opportunity right in front of you, I don’t know what to tell you.\n首先，我们之前讨论过自主性。就机会而言，我不能建议你改变你的实际办公地点，但如果你看不到眼前丰富的数字化机会，那我也不知道该说什么了。\nWith that said, I want to focus on what intelligence is in the context of these two other ingredients and this letter. For that, we look to cybernetics.\n综上所述，我想重点探讨一下， 在结合这两项要素和这封信的语境下 ，智能究竟是什么 。为此，我们需要借助控制论。\nCybernetics comes from the greek word kybernetikos which means “to steer” or “good at steering.”\n控制论一词源于希腊语 kybernetikos ，意思是“控制”或“擅长控制”。\nIt’s also known as “the art of getting what you want.”\n它也被称为“获得你想要的东西的艺术”。\nSo, if Naval’s definition of intelligence is getting what you want out of life, understanding cybernetics helps you do that much faster.\n所以，如果海军对智能的定义是获得你想要的生活，那么了解控制论可以帮助你更快地实现这个目标。\nCybernetics illustrates the properties of intelligent systems.\n控制论阐述了智能系统的特性。\nTo have a goal.\n要有目标。\nAct toward that goal.\n朝着这个目标行动。\nSense where you are.\n感受一下自己身处何地。\nCompare it to the goal.\n将其与目标进行比较。\nAnd act again based on that feedback.\n根据反馈再次采取行动。\n[\n](https://x.com/thedankoe/article/2010751592346030461/media/2010747174431428608)\nYou can judge intelligence based on the system’s ability to iterate and persist with trial and error.\n你可以根据系统反复试验和坚持不懈地纠错的能力来判断其智能程度。\nA ship blown off course that corrects toward its destination. A thermostat sensing a change in heat and turning on. The pancreas excreting insulin after blood glucose spikes.\n一艘被风吹离航线的船，随后修正航向，驶向目的地。一个恒温器感知到温度变化并启动。胰腺在血糖飙升后分泌胰岛素。\nWhat does this have to do with getting what you want out of life?\n这和你如何实现人生目标有什么关系呢？\nEverything.\n一切。\nActing, sensing, comparing, and understanding the system from a meta-perspective is fundamental to high intelligence (with the definition we are using here).\n从元视角行动、感知、比较和理解系统是高智能（按照我们这里使用的定义）的基础。\nHigh intelligence is the ability to iterate, persist, and understand the big picture. The mark of low intelligence is the inability to learn from your mistakes.\n高智商是指能够反复尝试、坚持不懈并理解全局的能力。 低智商的标志是无法从错误中吸取教训。\nLow-intelligence people get stuck on problems rather than solving them. They hit a roadblock and quit. Like a writer who fails to build a readership and quits because they lack the ability to try new things, experiment, and figure out a process that works for them (to think that there isn’t an effective process you can create is verifiably false, no matter your limiting beliefs, hence being low intelligence.)\n低智商的人往往纠结于问题本身，而不是解决问题。他们遇到瓶颈就放弃。就像一个作家，因为缺乏尝试新事物、进行实验和找到适合自己的方法的能力，而无法建立读者群，最终放弃一样（认为不存在有效的方法，无论你的认知有多么局限，都是错误的，因此这种想法属于低智商）。\nHigh intelligence is realizing any problem can be solved on a large enough timescale. The reality is that you can achieve any goal you set your mind to.\n高智商意味着意识到任何问题在足够长的时间尺度上都能得到解决。事实上，只要你下定决心，就能实现任何目标。\nIntelligence is realizing that there is a series of choices you can make which lead to achieving the goal you want. You understand that ideas are hierarchical and that you can’t go from papyrus to Google docs in one fell swoop. Even if that goal is impossible right now, you simply don’t have the resources – which may be invented over the next few years – to achieve that thing.\n智慧在于意识到， 你可以做出一系列选择，最终达成目标。你明白思想是有层级的，不可能一步登天，从纸莎草纸直接过渡到谷歌文档。即使现在这个目标看似不可能实现，你也只是暂时缺乏必要的资源——这些资源或许会在未来几年内出现。\nWhen I talk about “goals,” and as I will continue repeating, I am not speaking from the typical lens of self-help, although that’s a helpful lens to adopt at times.\n当我谈到“目标”时，正如我将继续重复的那样，我并不是从典型的自助角度来谈论的，尽管有时采用这种角度是有帮助的。\nI am speaking from the lens of teleology or the Greek kosmos – that everything serves a purpose. That everything is a part of a greater whole.\n我是从目的论或希腊宇宙观的角度来看待这个问题的——万物皆有其目的 ，万物都是更大整体的一部分。\nGoals determine how you see the world.\n目标决定了你如何看待世界。\nGoals determine what you consider “success” or “failure.”\n目标决定了你对“成功”或“失败”的定义。\nYou can try to “enjoy the journey,” but if you pursue the wrong goal, you will not enjoy it.\n你可以尝试“享受过程”，但如果你追求的目标是错误的，你就无法享受过程。\nYour mind is the operating system for reality.\n你的思维就是现实的操作系统。\nThat system is composed of goals.\n该系统由目标构成。\nFor most people, those goals are assigned to them. Programmed like lines of code in your psyche.\n对大多数人来说，这些目标是别人强加给他们的，就像代码一样被预先设定在你的潜意识里。\nGo to school. Get the job. Get offended. Play victim. Retire at 65.\n上学。找到工作。感到委屈。扮演受害者。65岁退休。\nA known path that doesn’t work.\n一条已知但行不通的路径。\nTo become more intelligent, you must:\n要想变得更聪明，你必须：\nReject the known path\n拒绝已知路径\nDive into the unknown\n潜入未知领域\nSet new, higher goals to expand your mind\n设定更高、更新的目标来拓展思维\nEmbrace the chaos and allow for growth\n拥抱混乱，允许成长。\nStudy the generalized principles of nature\n研究自然界的普遍规律\nBecome a deep generalist\n成为一名博学多才的通才\nI understand this may not be the traditional definition of intelligence, but that sequence of steps leads to an extraordinary level of connections in your brain, leading to what we would observe as an intelligent person. Pair that with agency and you\u0026rsquo;ve got a winner.\n我知道这可能并非传统意义上的智力定义，但这一系列步骤确实能使你的大脑形成非凡的连接，从而造就我们通常所说的聪明人。再加上自主性，你就成功了一半。\nThat leads us into the next section perfectly.\n这自然而然地引出了下一节。\nVI – How to launch into a completely new life (in 1 day)\n六、如何在一天内开启全新生活\nThe best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making.\n我生命中最美好的时光总是发生在我对自身毫无进展感到彻底厌倦之后。\nHow do you dig into your mind?\n你如何深入挖掘自己的内心世界？\nHow do you become aware of your conditioning?\n你如何意识到自己受到的制约？\nHow do you reach profound insights and truths that change the trajectory of your life?\n如何获得能够改变人生轨迹的深刻见解和真理？\nThrough the simple, but often painful act of questioning.\n通过简单却往往令人痛苦的提问行为。\nSomething that so few people do, and you can tell by how they speak or give their thoughts on a specific topic. Questioning is thinking, and very few people do it.\n很少有人会这样做，从他们说话的方式或对某个特定话题的看法就能看出来。提问也是一种思考，但很少有人会这样做。\nI want to give you a comprehensive protocol that you can use every year to reset your life and launch into a season of intense progress. This protocol helps you ask the right questions.\n我想给你一套全面的方案，你可以每年使用它来重塑生活，开启一段突飞猛进的进步期。这套方案能帮助你提出正确的问题。\nThese questions will cover the macro to the micro: where you want to be, what you need to do to get there, and what you can do immediately to start moving the needle toward that reality.\n这些问题将涵盖从宏观到微观的各个层面：你想去哪里，你需要做什么才能到达那里，以及你可以立即采取哪些措施来开始朝着这个目标迈进。\nThis will require one full day to complete, so I recommend you follow along with the exact protocol. You will need a pen, paper, and an open mind.\n这需要一整天的时间才能完成，所以我建议您严格按照步骤操作。您需要准备一支笔、一张纸和一颗开放的心。\nWhen I observe patterns in people who successfully flip their identity, it happens fast after a build up of tension. Specifically, I’ve noticed 3 phases that people tend to go through.\n我观察到，那些成功转变身份的人往往经历着某种模式：这种转变通常在紧张情绪积累之后迅速发生。具体来说，我注意到人们通常会经历三个阶段。\nDissonance – They feel like they don’t belong in their current life, and become sufficiently fed up with their lack of progress.\n认知失调 ——他们觉得自己不属于现在的生活，并且对缺乏进步感到非常厌倦。\nUncertainty – They don’t know what comes next, so they either experiment or get lost and feel worse.\n不确定性 ——他们不知道接下来会发生什么，所以他们要么尝试，要么迷失方向，感觉更糟。\nDiscovery – They discover what they want to pursue and make 6 years of progress in 6 months.\n探索 ——他们发现自己想要追求的目标，并在 6 个月内取得 6 年才能取得的进展。\nSo, our goal with this protocol is to help you reach the point of dissonance, navigate through uncertainty, and discover what it truly is that you want to achieve, so much so that the clarity is overwhelming and distractions no longer hold their weight.\n因此，我们制定此方案的目标是帮助你达到认知失调的临界点，克服不确定性，并发现你真正想要实现的目标，以至于这种清晰感让你感到无比震撼，而各种干扰因素也不再具有影响力。\nThis protocol is structured so that it can be completed in one day. In the morning, you do a psychological excavation to uncover your own hidden motives. During the day, you prompt yourself with interrupts to keep you out of autopilot and contemplate your life. At night, you synthesize the insights into a direction you will start to move in tomorrow.\n这个方案的结构设计使其可以在一天内完成。早上，你进行一次心理挖掘，揭示自己隐藏的动机。白天，你会不时地打断自己，让自己摆脱自动驾驶模式，思考自己的人生。晚上，你综合这些感悟，形成明天行动的方向。\nI cannot guarantee that this will work for everyone, because I cannot guarantee that everyone reading this is in the right chapter of their own story that would make these points impactful. You can’t place the climax at the start of the book and expect it to be interesting.\n我无法保证这种方法对每个人都有效，因为我无法保证每个读者都处于自己人生故事的合适阶段，从而使这些观点产生影响。你不能把高潮放在书的开头，还指望它引人入胜。\nPart 1) Morning – Psychological Excavation – Vision \u0026amp; Anti-Vision\n第一部分）上午——心理挖掘——视觉与反视觉\nFirst we must create a new frame, or lens of perception, for your mind to operate from.\n首先，我们必须为你的思维创造一个新的框架或感知视角。\nThis is like creating a new shell, leaving your old one, and slowly growing into it over time. It won’t feel like it fits at first. That’s a good thing.\n这就像创造一个新的外壳，离开旧的，然后随着时间的推移慢慢适应它。一开始你会觉得不合身，但这反而是件好事。\nSet aside 15-30 minutes (the length of one YouTube video\u0026hellip; you can do it) to think about and answer these questions. Do not attempt to outsource this contemplation to AI. I want you to break past the limiter that is on your mind. If you can’t answer these immediately, come back to them later.\n请抽出 15-30 分钟（相当于看完一个 YouTube 视频的时间……你一定可以做到）来思考并回答以下问题。不要试图把思考工作外包给人工智能。我希望你能突破思维的局限。如果你现在无法回答这些问题，可以稍后再来思考。\nWhat is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you’ve learned to live with? Not the deep suffering but what you’ve learned to tolerate. (If you don’t hate it, you will tolerate it)\n你已经学会忍受的那种迟钝而持久的不满是什么？不是那种刻骨铭心的痛苦，而是你已经学会容忍的那种不满。（如果你不憎恨它，你就会容忍它。）\nWhat do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change? Write down the three complaints you’ve voiced most often in the past year.\n你总是抱怨哪些事情，但却从未真正改变过？写下你在过去一年中最常抱怨的三件事。\nFor each complaint: What would someone who watched your behavior (not your words) conclude that you actually want?\n针对每一项抱怨：观察你的行为（而不是你的言语）的人会得出你真正想要的是什么结论？\nWhat truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to someone you deeply respect?\n你现在生活中有哪些真相是你无法向你非常尊敬的人坦白的？\nThose questions are meant to make you aware of the pain in your current life. Now, we need to turn those into what I call an “anti-vision,” which is a brutal awareness of the life you do not want to live. That way, you can use that negative energy to aim your efforts in a positive direction and act from a place of intrinsic motivation.\n这些问题旨在让你意识到当前生活中的痛苦。现在，我们需要将这些痛苦转化为我所谓的“反愿景”，即对你不想要的生活的残酷认知。这样，你就能利用这种负能量，将你的努力导向积极的方向，并出于内在动力而行动。\nIf absolutely nothing changes for the next five years, describe an average Tuesday. Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like? What’s the first thing you think about? Who’s around you? What do you do between 9am and 6pm? How do you feel at 10pm?\n如果未来五年内一切照旧，请描述一下你平常的星期二。你在哪里醒来？你的身体感觉如何？你想到的第一件事是什么？你身边有哪些人？从早上9点到下午6点，你都做了些什么？晚上10点你感觉如何？\nNow do it but for ten years. What have you missed? What opportunities closed? Who gave up on you? What do people say about you when you’re not in the room?\n现在，试着把时间延长十年。你错过了什么？哪些机会溜走了？谁放弃了你？当你不在场时，人们会怎么评价你？\nYou’re at the end of your life. You lived the safe version. You never broke the pattern. What was the cost? What did you never let yourself feel, try, or become?\n你已走到生命的尽头。你过着安稳的生活，从未打破过既定的模式。为此付出了什么代价？你从未让自己感受过、尝试过、成为过什么？\nWho in your life is already living the future you just described? Someone five, ten, twenty years ahead on the same trajectory? What do you feel when you think about becoming them?\n你身边有哪些人已经过上了你刚才描述的未来？那些比你领先五年、十年、二十年，走着同样道路的人呢？当你想到自己会成为他们时，你有什么感受？\nWhat identity would you have to give up to actually change? (”I am the type of person who\u0026hellip;”) What would it cost you socially to no longer be that person?\n为了真正改变自己，你需要放弃哪些身份？（“我以前是那种人……”）不再做那样的人，你在社交方面会付出怎样的代价？\nWhat is the most embarrassing reason you haven’t changed? The one that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than reasonable?\n你至今没有改变的最尴尬的理由是什么？那个让你听起来软弱、害怕或懒惰，而不是合情合理的理由？\nIf your current behavior is a form of self-protection, what exactly are you protecting? And what is that protection costing you?\n如果你目前的行为是一种自我保护，那么你究竟在保护什么？这种保护又让你付出了什么代价？\nIf you answered those truthfully, and if you are in the right chapter of your life, you will feel a deep sense of dis-ease and possibly disgust for how you are currently living. Now, we need to orient that energy in a positive direction. We need to create a minimum viable vision, because your vision is like a product. It starts out unclear, but with time and experience, it grows stronger and more potent.\n如果你如实回答了这些问题，并且正处于人生的正确阶段，你会对目前的生活方式感到深深的不安，甚至可能感到厌恶。现在，我们需要引导这种能量朝着积极的方向发展。我们需要制定一个最小可行愿景，因为你的愿景就像一个产品。它起初可能并不清晰，但随着时间和经验的积累，它会变得越来越清晰、越来越有力。\nForget practicality for a minute. If you could snap your fingers and be living a different life in three years, not what’s realistic, what you actually want? What does an average Tuesday look like? Same level of detail as question 5.\n暂时抛开实际因素。如果你能打个响指，三年后就能过上截然不同的生活，想想你真正想要的是什么，而不是现实的那种 ？一个普通的星期二会是什么样子？细节程度与第五题相同。\nWhat would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel natural rather than forced? Write the identity statement: “I am the type of person who\u0026hellip;”\n你对自己有怎样的信念，才能让那种生活感觉自然而非勉强？请写下你的自我认同宣言：“我是那种……”\nWhat is one thing you would do this week if you were already that person?\n如果你已经是那样的人，这周你会做什么事？\nAnswer all of those first thing in the morning tomorrow.\n明天一早先回答所有这些问题。\nPart 2) Throughout The Day – Interrupting Autopilot – Breaking Unconscious Patterns\n第二部分）全天——打破自动驾驶模式——打破无意识的行事方式\nThese journaling exercises are cute, but we want real change.\n这些写日记的练习很有趣，但我们想要的是真正的改变。\nFrankly, that’s not going to happen if you don’t break the current unconscious patterns that are keeping you the same.\n坦白说，如果你不打破目前让你停滞不前的无意识模式，这一切都不会发生。\nThroughout the day, I want you to contemplate on everything you journaled in part one. Beyond that, I don’t want you to forget to contemplate. Please take this seriously. You aren’t going to change by doing the same thing for the rest of your life. You need to consciously force a pattern break.\n今天一整天，我都希望你认真思考你在第一部分日记里记录的所有内容。除此之外，我也希望你不要忘记思考。请认真对待这件事。如果你一辈子都做同样的事情，你不会改变的。你需要有意识地打破旧有的模式。\nTake the time right now to create reminders or calendar events in your phone. Include the question in the reminder or event so that you can immediately start thinking about it.\n现在就花点时间在手机里创建提醒或日历事件。把这个问题也添加到提醒或事件中，这样你就可以立即开始思考它。\nThe more random and non-conflicting with your schedule there are, the better.\n越是随机且不与你的日程安排冲突，就越好。\n11:00am: What am I avoiding right now by doing what I’m doing?\n上午 11:00： 我现在做的事情究竟在逃避什么？\n1:30pm: If someone filmed the last two hours, what would they conclude I want from my life?\n下午 1:30： 如果有人拍摄了过去两个小时的影像，他们会得出什么样的结论？我想要怎样的生活？\n3:15pm: Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?\n下午 3:15： 我是在走向我讨厌的生活，还是走向我想要的生活？\n5:00pm: What’s the most important thing I’m pretending isn’t important?\n下午 5:00： 我假装不重要的最重要的事情是什么？\n7:30pm: What did I do today out of identity protection rather than genuine desire? (Hint: it’s most things you do)\n晚上 7:30： 今天我做了哪些事是为了保护身份而非出于真心？（提示：你做的绝大多数事都是如此）\n9:00pm: When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most dead?\n晚上 9 点： 今天我什么时候感觉自己最有活力？什么时候感觉自己最麻木？\nTo add a bit more fuel to the fire, schedule these questions during times where you are either commuting, walking, or lying around.\n为了进一步激发思考，不妨在通勤、散步或闲坐的时候安排这些问题。\nWhat would change if I stopped needing people to see me as [the identity you wrote in question 10]?\n如果我不再需要别人把我视为[你在问题 10 中写到的身份]，会发生什么变化？\nWhere in my life am I trading aliveness for safety?\n我生活中哪些方面为了安全而牺牲了活力？\nWhat’s the smallest version of the person I want to become that I could be tomorrow?\n我明天能成为的那个人的最小版本是什么？\nPart 3) Evening – Synthesizing Insight – Entering A Season Of Progress\n第三部分）晚间——综合洞察——进入进步的季节\nIf you followed that process, I would be surprised if you didn’t have at least one profound insight that could alter the course of your life. Now, we need to make those known, integrate them into who we are, and act on them to begin solidifying our journey to a new level of mind.\n如果你遵循这个过程，我敢肯定你至少会获得一个足以改变你人生轨迹的深刻洞见。现在，我们需要将这些洞见表达出来，将它们融入我们自身，并付诸行动，从而开启通往更高心智境界的旅程。\nAfter today, what feels most true about why you’ve been stuck?\n今天过后，你觉得你一直以来陷入困境的原因最真实的是什么？\nWhat is the actual enemy? Name it clearly. Not circumstances. Not other people. The internal pattern or belief that has been running the show.\n真正的敌人是什么？明确指出来。不是环境，也不是其他人，而是主导一切的内在模式或信念。\nWrite a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let your life become. This is your anti-vision compressed. It should make you feel something when you read it.\n用一句话概括你绝不接受的生活现状。这就是你对未来的愿景。读到它时，你应该有所感触。\nWrite a single sentence that captures what you’re building toward, knowing it will evolve. This is your vision MVP.\n用一句话概括你正在构建的目标，要知道它会不断发展演变。这就是你的愿景 MVP（最小可行产品）。\nLastly, we need to create goals.\n最后，我们需要制定目标。\nAgain, these aren’t goals that you set for the sake of achievement, because goals are just projections. They are unreliable and make you feel bound to something that will inevitably change. Instead, think of goals as a point of view. A lens that you can exchange to enter the right state of mind to perform the action that will lead away from the life you don’t want. Do not worry about some kind of finish line, because as we will find, it doesn’t exist. Enjoyment is found in progress.\n再次强调，这些目标并非为了达成而设定，因为目标只是一种预期。它们并不可靠，会让你感觉被某种终将改变的事物所束缚。相反，你应该把目标看作一种视角，一种可以让你调整心态、摆脱不想要的生活的视角。不要担心所谓的终点线，因为我们会发现，它并不存在。真正的乐趣在于过程。\nOne-year lens: What would have to be true in one year for you to know you’ve broken the old pattern? One concrete thing.\n一年期视角： 一年后，什么事情必须成真，你才能知道自己已经打破了旧模式？一件具体的事情。\nOne-month lens: What would have to be true in one month for the one-year lens to remain possible?\n一个月镜头： 为了使一年镜头仍然可行，一个月内必须满足哪些条件？\nDaily lens: What are 2-3 actions you can timeblock tomorrow that the person you’re becoming would simply do?\n每日思考： 明天你可以安排时间做哪 2-3 件你想成为的那种人会毫不犹豫地去做的事情？\nThat was a lot.\n那可真不少。\nHopefully it was helpful.\n希望对您有所帮助。\nBut we have one last piece to lock it all in.\n但我们还需要最后一块拼图才能最终敲定一切。\nStick with me.\n跟着我。\nVII – Turn Your Life Into A Video Game\n第七章——把你的生活变成电子游戏\nThe optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy—or attention—is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else. – Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n最佳的内在体验状态是意识井然有序的状态。当心理能量（或注意力）投入到切实可行的目标中，并且技能与行动机会相匹配时，这种状态便会实现。追求目标能够带来意识的秩序，因为人必须将注意力集中在手头的任务上，并暂时忘却其他一切。 ——米哈里·契克森米哈伊\nYou now have all of the components that lead to a good life.\n你现在拥有了美好生活所需的所有要素。\nNow, it may be helpful to organize all of your insights into one coherent plan. Pull out a new page and write down these 6 components:\n现在，将你所有的见解整理成一个连贯的计划可能会有所帮助。请另起一张纸，写下以下六个组成部分：\nAnti-vision – What is the bane of my existence, or the life I never want to experience again?\n反愿景 ——我存在的祸根是什么？或者说，我永远不想再经历的人生是什么？\nVision – What is the ideal life that I think I want and can improve as I work toward it?\n愿景 ——我理想中的生活是什么样的？我可以通过努力不断改善这种生活？\n1 year goal – What will my life look like in 1 year time, and is that closer to the life I want?\n一年目标 ——一年后我的生活会是什么样子？这是否更接近我想要的生活？\n1 month project – What do I need to learn? What skills do I need to acquire? What can I build that will move me closer to the one year goal?\n一个月项目 ——我需要学习什么？我需要掌握哪些技能？我可以构建什么来让我更接近一年目标？\nDaily levers – What are the priority, needle-moving tasks that bring my project closer to completion?\n日常关键因素 ——哪些是能够推动项目进展、使项目更接近完成的优先事项？\nConstraints – What am I not willing to sacrifice to achieve my vision from the ground up?\n限制条件 ——为了从零开始实现我的愿景，我不愿意牺牲什么？\nWhy is this so powerful?\n为什么它如此强大？\nBecause these components literally create your own little world. If you are meant to pursue this hierarchy of goals at this stage of your life, you will have no other option but to become obsessed. You will feel the pull to something greater. You will not see anything else as an option.\n因为这些要素实际上构建了你自己的小世界。如果你注定要在人生的这个阶段追求这一系列目标，你别无选择，只能全身心投入。你会感受到一种对更高目标的渴望。你会认为其他任何选择都不算数。\nYou turn your life into a video game.\n你把生活变成了电子游戏。\nBecause games are the poster child for obsession, enjoyment, and flow states. They have all the components that lead to focus and clarity, so if we reverse engineer what those components are, we can live in a state of deeper enjoyment, less distractions, and more success.\n因为游戏是痴迷、享受和心流状态的典型代表。它们具备所有带来专注和清晰思维的要素，所以如果我们反向推导出这些要素是什么，我们就能生活在更深层次的享受、更少的干扰和更大的成功之中。\nYour vision is how you win. At least until the game evolves.\n你的远见决定你的胜负 。至少在游戏规则改变之前是这样。\nYour anti-vision is what’s at stake. What happens if you lose or give up.\n你的反愿景才是关键所在 。 如果你失败或放弃，会发生什么？\nYour 1 year goal is the mission. This is your sole priority in life.\n你一年的目标就是使命 。这是你人生中唯一的首要任务。\nYour 1 month project is the boss fight. How you gain XP and acquire loot.\n你为期一个月的项目就是打最终 boss 。你将如何获得经验值和战利品？\nYour daily levers are the quests. The daily process that unlocks new opportunities.\n你每天的杠杆就是任务 。这是解锁新机遇的日常流程。\nYour constraints are the rules. The limitations that encourage creativity.\n你的限制就是规则 。正是这些限制激发了创造力。\nAll of these act as a concentric set of circles, like a forcefield, that guard your mind from distractions and shiny objects.\n所有这些都像一组同心圆，如同力场一样，保护你的心灵免受干扰和闪亮物体的侵害。\nThe more you play the game, the stronger this force becomes, and soon enough it becomes who you are, and you wouldn’t have it any other way.\n你玩这个游戏越多，这种力量就越强，很快它就会成为你的一部分，而你也不会希望它变成别的样子。\n–

出新之后，隔三岔五的弹窗更新，总让我担心手滑点到「立即更新」，虽然有二次确认。但最近更新频繁，我想找个一劳永逸的办法。\n我想要屏蔽更新的几个原因：\n强迫症看着那个红点难受 新系统老机器带不动，怕更新了变卡 工作环境需要稳定，不想瞎折腾，更新后担心开发环境炸掉 macOS 26 的液态玻璃风格我很讨厌，同时也担心更新后部分 app 不能匹配 遂决定升级到 macOS 15.7.3 之后，彻底屏蔽 macOS 更新，同时消除小红点\n第一步：UI屏蔽软件更新及自动下载 打开「设置」-「通用」-「软件更新」 点击右边的 ⓘ 图标 把「自动保持我的 Mac 最新」关掉 第二步：修改host 屏蔽更新 这一步的操作是为了禁止连接到macOS更新服务器\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 sudo vim /etc/hosts 并且在下面加入以下行

mac 之后，过去4年，每隔1-2年就要有一次开发环境崩溃，我为自己过于激进导致的浪费时间感到后悔。\n今年正式用上了Time

ZeroTier简介 ZeroTier是一款基于P2P技术的虚拟局域网（VPN）工具，它能够将分布在全球各地的设备连接在一个虚拟的局域网中。通过ZeroTier，您可以实现：\n远程访问：在公司用手机直接访问家里的NAS设备 设备互联：让分布在不同地理位置的设备如同在同一个局域网内一样通信 点对点直连：设备间直接通信，无需经过中转服务器，既快速又安全 工作原理 ZeroTier的工作原理涉及三个关键概念：\nPLANET（行星服务器）：ZeroTier网络的核心根服务器，负责网络发现和初始连接，相当于整个网络的\u0026quot;中枢\u0026quot; MOON（卫星服务器）：用户可以自建的私有根服务器，作为区域性的代理节点，帮助就近的设备更快地建立连接 LEAF（叶子节点）：所有接入ZeroTier网络的终端设备，如电脑、手机、服务器等 设备之间的连接过程是：首先通过PLANET或MOON进行发现和协商，然后尽可能建立P2P直连，只有在无法直连的情况下才会通过中转方式进行通信。\n为什么自建Planet服务器？ 虽然ZeroTier官方提供了免费的PLANET服务器，但在实际使用中存在以下问题：\n网络延迟：官方服务器位于海外，国内用户访问延迟高且不稳定 连接速度：本地化的PLANET服务器可以显著加快设备间的连接建立速度 网络控制：自建服务器让您完全掌控网络配置，可根据需求进行优化调整 安全性：私有化部署意味着网络流量不经过第三方服务器，更加安全可靠 独立性：避免因官方服务器故障或网络波动影响业务正常运行 如何自建Planet服务器？ 我们将使用xubiaolin/docker-zerotier-planet项目，通过Docker容器快速部署私有的Planet服务器。\n环境准备 在开始安装之前，请确保您的服务器满足以下条件：\n拥有公网IP地址 开放以下端口： 3443/tcp（管理面板，默认可调整） 9994/tcp（ZeroTier通信，默认可调整） 9994/udp（ZeroTier通信，默认可调整） 安装必要的软件依赖： Docker（容器运行环境） Git（获取项目代码） 部署步骤 安装依赖软件 1 2 3 4 5 # Debian/Ubuntu系统 apt

docker-zerotier-planet chmod +x deploy.sh ./deploy.sh 根据提示选择\u0026quot;安装\u0026quot;选项，脚本将自动完成部署过程，通常需要1-3分钟。\n获取配置文件 部署完成后，会在./data/zerotier/dist目录下生成planet和moon配置文件。您可以通过安装完成后提供的URL直接下载，或使用SCP等工具从服务器下载。\n访问管理面板 部署完成后，可通过http://服务器IP:3443访问管理面板，默认账号为admin，默认密码为password。\n使用自建Planet服务器组网 创建网络 登录管理面板后，点击\u0026quot;Networks\u0026quot;菜单 点击\u0026quot;Add Network\u0026quot;按钮创建新网络 输入网络名称，其他选项保持默认 记录生成的网络ID，后续客户端配置需要用到 客户端配置 Windows客户端 从ZeroTier官网下载并安装客户端

的心态彻底躺平，有人已经急着改简历四处投，还有些大佬稳得很，该唱歌该聚会一点不耽误。​\n我自己也从最初的慌得不行，慢慢沉下心来坦然面对了。前阵子是真焦虑：白天刷着群消息上蹿下跳，晚上躺着想未来翻来覆去睡不着；现在能稳住，一方面是知道还有段缓冲期，不用逼自己立刻做决定，另一方面也多亏家里经济压力没那么大，给了我喘口气的空间。​\n也是这阵儿，终于能静下心来想：我到底想要什么样的生活？​\n自从有了娃，这个答案越来越清晰 —— 还是现在的远程办公节奏最适配我。我们团队核心成员都在外地，本地办公室就我一个开发，这几年早摸清了异步办公的门道，甚至有点享受这种自由：不用挤早高峰地铁，中午能陪娃吃顿饭，晚上还能哄他睡了再回电脑前干活。尤其今年，越来越觉得 “工作地点不被绑住” 对我来说太重要了，所以下份工作，远程岗还是我的首选。​\n当然我也清楚现实：现在大环境本来就水深火热，我英语也就刚过六级的水平，想找远程岗不算容易。可国内卷得厉害也是真的，总不能只看眼前，得为未来 10 年多做打算，咬咬牙也得冲。​\n一旦把目标捋清楚，心里瞬间就亮堂了 —— 接下来就按部就班啃三个 “硬骨头”：​\n英语：把 “三天打鱼” 改成 “每天 1 小时”​ 以前总觉得 “学英语” 是个虚头巴脑的事儿，六级刚过的底子，学起来也是三天打鱼两天晒网，没坚持过正经周期。这次不一样，目标明确：为了能匹配远程岗的沟通需求，得把英语捡起来。​\n今天刚把 Anki 和配套插件折腾好，还咬咬牙买了套针对性的课程资料，给自己定了死规矩：每天不管多忙，都要留 1 小时啃英语 —— 背单词、练听力，一步一步来，总比原地不动强。​\n算法：躲不过就正面刚，先啃 Top 100​ 算法一直是我的软肋，以前总想着 “能躲就躲”，可现在看明白了：不管是全球远程岗，还是国内坐班岗，算法都是绕不开的坎。​\n也不贪心，先把 Top 100 的经典题啃完再说。再多精力确实跟不上，先把基础打牢，至少面试时不会慌到说不出话。​\n技术：补短板，该背的 “八股” 不偷懒​ 简历倒还好，针对性改改应该能过关，但技术上的短板得补：国内面试常考的场景题、国外重视的 System Design，我以前接触得少，这段时间得集中恶补。​\n还有那些中英文的 “八股文” 考点，该背的还是得老老实实背 —— 毕竟面试时，基础扎实才是底气。​\n说起来挺巧，Anki 去年就下载过，那会儿没目标没动力，一直躺在手机里吃灰。以前总想着 “求稳就好”，不想折腾，可这次突然想通了：趁现在还不算老，总得再冲一把试试。要是连这点勇气都没有，恐怕连自己都会看不起自己吧。​\n慢慢来，至少现在，我知道下一步该往哪走了。​\n","date":"2025-10-11T23:01:31+08:00","permalink":"/p/new-beginning/","title":"New beginning"},{"content":"工作

arm后，右风扇在启动时会不转而且会滋滋响，我认为是因为当时的迁移导致某些配置不正常，这个拖了大概4 年一直没有解决，我期望通过升级解决这个问题。可惜非常遗憾，近期（可能会选在 51 节）恢复系统，全部重装一遍，毕竟配置开发环境是个大活 绿群晖 DXP4800 从 DMS7.2.1 改到了绿联本身的系统。一是不喜欢群晖 app 多到爆，二是不爱群晖硬盘不能休眠，三是某天群晖启动之后web

DXP4800-黑群晖小记](https://blog.xiaohuangyu.space/p/dxp4800-synology/) 研究了几种外网访问内网设备的方案，在这里做个总结。本文是该系列的开篇，主要介绍各种方案的优缺点和适用场景。 网上搜索外网访问内网，局域网访问，远程连接，远程访问 docker，基本都可以归类为人不在家，想访问家中的nas 及其他的设备，所以标题暂时起名为远程访问系列\n远程访问方案梳理 1. 基于公网 IP 的直接访问方案 优点：直接利用公网 IP 访问，无需中转，速度快。支持 ipv4/ipv6。 缺点：依赖运营商分配公网 IP，安全风险高。 适用场景：有公网 IP 的网络环境，如部分企业专线、有公网 IP 的家庭网络。 2. VPN（虚拟专用网络）方案 优点：安全加密，可完整访问内网。 缺点：需服务器或依赖 Cloudflare 服务，配置复杂。 适用场景：企业办公环境。 软件推荐：OpenVPN、WireGuard。 3. 内网穿透方案 优点：无需公网 IP，配置灵活。 缺点：依赖中转服务器，且访问速度与中转服务器带宽有关，需要额外付费，并且可能有延迟。 适用场景：临时远程访问，如开发测试。 软件推荐：frp、ngrok。 4. ZeroTier 异地组网方案 优点：P2P 连接，配置简单。 缺点：免费版限制设备数量，且存在打洞失败几率，但可使用自建 planet 一类的来突破限制（需要服务器）。 适用场景：小型组网，如家庭网络。 5. Cloudflare Tunnel 方案 优点：安全性高，配置简单。 缺点：依赖 Cloudflare 服务，因众所周知的原因速度访问巨慢。 适用场景：Web 服务、应用访问。 个人比较推荐方案 1和方案 4，理由如下\n付费少 配置相对简单 打通之后，需要少量配置或无需配置即可实现多设备访问 本文先介绍如何使用公网 ip 来进行远程访问，本文先假定能够开通 ipv4,具体操作步骤如下\n基于公网 IPV4 的直接访问方案 一、获取公网IP 1. 申请公网IP 联系宽带运营商客服申请开通公网IP 根据运营商政策可能需要更换套餐或支付额外费用 可能获得的公网IP类型： 固定IPv4（地址不变，费用较高，一般申请不到） 动态IPv4（光猫重启后地址可能会变化，所以需要域名配合ddns 解析） 动态IPv6（现在运营商普遍支持，但需要配合动态 dns 解析） 2. 验证公网IP 访问 https://ip138.com/ 或直接百度搜 ip 查询当前 ip 使用命令行工具检查： Windows: ipconfig /all Linux/Mac: ifconfig 或 ip addr 注意区分内网IP（192.168.x.x、10.x.x.x等）和公网IP，且注意路由器或光猫是否响应 ping 命令 二、网络环境配置 1. 光猫设置 理想情况：直接在光猫配置端口转发 需要运营商提供超级管理员密码 配置较简单，性能较好 现实情况：多数无法获取超级管理员权限，且光猫性能垃圾，多设备连接了之后会异常卡 需要将光猫改为桥接模式，自己额外接路由器 可能需要运营商远程协助设置 可能遇到的问题及解决方案 运营商不给开公网ip =\u0026gt; 投诉 运营商不给开桥接 =》 投诉 2. 路由器配置 选购支持端口转发的路由器 设置路由器PPPoE拨号 输入宽带账号密码 配置端口转发 选择需要转发的内部端口 设置对应的外部端口 指定内网设备IP地址 选择协议类型（TCP/UDP） 可能遇到的问题及解决方案 拿不到宽带账号密码 =》 投诉 验证自己的路由器是否获取到公网 ip =》 https://ip138.com 看ip 是否与路由器后台 ip 一致，且不为192.168.xxx.xxx ，不为 10.xx.xx.xx 验证端口转发是否生效 =\u0026gt; 假定获取到的公网ip 为 222.71.193.9 配置的转发为 9999 端口转发到内网 192.168.1.200 机器的 5001 端口，则执行命令 1 2 3 4 \u0026gt; telnet 222.71.193.9 9999 回车 Trying 222.71.193.9... Connected to 222.71.193.9. Escape character is \u0026#39;^]\u0026#39;. (出现这行表示正常，如果没出现则依次排查应用状态，防火墙状态，端口转发是否正确) 3. 防火墙设置 路由器防火墙配置 开放必要端口 设置访问控制规则 启用基本安全防护 内网设备防火墙配置 允许相关端口访问 配置访问白名单 启用安全防护措施 完成上述配置之后，在外网可以直接通过 http://公网ip:端口转发外部port 访问相关的 web 应用,此处的 ip 为公网 ip，port 为配置的外网端口转发，假定获取到的公网ip 为 222.71.193.9 配置的转发为 9999 端口转发到内网 192.168.1.200 机器的 5000 端口（群晖默认端口），则访问地址为 http://222.71.193.9:9999 ，但运营商给的是动态 ip，可能会在某些特定的时候自动改变，或者是在路由器重启时重新分配，重新分配之后，就原来的方式就不能访问了，所以为了使用方便，都希望直接使用某个域名来远程访问内部服务，接下来就需要介绍后续DDNS 了\nDDNS （Dynamic DNS), 熟悉 DNS 的小伙伴都知道 DNS 是将域名转为 IP 地址的服务，直接复习下\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 DDNS（动态域名系统）和DNS（域名系统）是两个相关但不同的概念。以下是它们的主要区别： ### DNS（域名系统） - **全球性服务**：DNS是一个全球性的服务，它将人类易于记忆的域名转换为计算机使用的IP地址。 - **静态解析**：传统的DNS服务通常用于静态IP地址，即域名与IP地址的映射是固定的，不会随时间变化。 - **分布式系统**：DNS是一个分层的分布式系统，包括根服务器、顶级域名服务器、权威名称服务器和递归服务器。 - **缓存机制**：DNS查询结果通常被缓存，以提高解析速度和减轻DNS服务器的负载。 - **适用于静态IP**：对于拥有静态公网IP的用户或企业来说，传统的DNS服务是合适的。 ### DDNS（动态域名系统） - **动态IP支持**：DDNS服务允许用户将一个固定的域名与动态变化的IP地址关联起来，特别适用于家庭用户和小型办公室，他们的公网IP地址可能会因为重新连接互联网而变化。 - **自动更新**：DDNS服务会自动检测IP地址的变化，并更新DNS记录，确保域名始终指向当前的IP地址。 - **依赖第三方服务**：DDNS服务通常由第三方提供商提供，用户需要在服务提供商的平台上注册域名，并配置DDNS服务。 - **客户端软件**：用户通常需要在本地网络设备上安装客户端软件，该软件会监测IP地址的变化，并与DDNS服务提供商的服务器通信以更新DNS记录。 - **适用于动态IP**：对于没有静态公网IP的用户来说，DDNS服务是必要的，以便他们能够通过一个固定的域名来访问或管理他们的网络设备。 总结来说，DNS是一个全球性的域名解析服务，而DDNS是DNS服务的一个扩展，专门为动态IP地址提供域名解析服务。DDNS解决了动态IP地址环境下域名解析的问题，使得用户可以通过一个固定的域名来访问他们的设备，即使这些设备的IP地址可能会变化。 DDNS是直接将域名转化为动态 ip，这样我们配置好之后就直接能用固定的域名访问内网中的各种服务了\n三、域名解析配置（可选） 1. 域名准备 购买域名 配置DNS服务器 2. DDNS配置 选择DDNS软件 DDNS-GO Lucky NO-IP 花生壳 软件配置 设置域名提供商API，网上教程太多 不过多赘述，参考各个软件官方文档即可 配置更新间隔 选择需要解析的域名 运行方式 物理机直接运行 Docker容器运行 路由器插件运行 3. 解析验证 测试域名解析是否正确 可能遇到的问题及解决方案 测试域名解析是否正确 =\u0026gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ❯ ping 你配置在 ddns 软件里的域名 比如 ping nas.abcdefg.com PING nas.abcdefg.com (222.71.193.9): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 222.71.193.9: icmp_seq=0 ttl=50 time=12.410 ms 64 bytes from 222.71.193.9: icmp_seq=1 ttl=50 time=13.020 ms 64 bytes from 222.71.193.9: icmp_seq=2 ttl=50 time=15.120 ms 重复出现的 ip与自己公网 ip 一致即可 如果在配置 ddns 之前如果都没问题，但是 ddns 解析有问题，可能需要关注下自己是否使用了相关代理软件，修改代理规则，我曾经遇到过使用 cloudflare 的 dns，同时在路由器上配置了代理，再使用 ddns 时发现 cloudflare 上的 dns 解析一直是解析到某海外 ip，排查之后发现是规则设置的问题\n四、测试验证 测试部分，不做过多数据测试，能满足自己要求即可\n1. 基础连通性测试 Ping测试 ping 公网IP ping 域名（如果配置了域名） 端口检测 使用在线端口检测工具 telnet测试端口连通性 2. 性能测试 带宽测试

,在我看来无异于偷。或许是因为我小时候有过类似的经历，小学时从家里偷拿钱断断续续有半年，在某天也不知是被同学告发还是被父母发现，总之最后换来一顿毒打，所以对这次的事情才更为重视。人总是要为自己的行为负责，无论是父母或者是当事者本人。\n最近天气炎热，已经连续三天高温橙色预警，确实也没心思陪着父母在外面闲逛，之前来的两次，能玩能去的地方几乎已经去的差不多了，所以这次没有单独请假陪他们，只是让他们白天在家休息，晚上陪他们逛逛。客观来讲，我觉得这次我做的一般，行为上或许说的过去，妻子安排酒店，我们给父亲过生日，带他们出去逛圈溜达，但是在内心深处，总是在说父母和弟弟不沟通，不多问，想当然，有的时候也有一种哀其不幸怒其不争的感觉；或许有点夸张，但是看着弟弟的时候，总觉得完全不懂事，又呆头呆脑，问的问题大多都是废话比如这个灯是在哪，那个是在哪，这个皮搋子是通马桶还是通下水道的，理解能力有问题还不认真听。我在想或许自己 18 岁的时候，也是这样？ 又或者比他更甚。\n看见弟弟和父亲坐着躺着的姿势千奇百怪，而我每次说他们的语气总是特别冷淡，像是针对谁，希望他们不要介意，套用许多年前的话，我也是为了你们好😁。总是希望在有限的时间内教会弟弟为人处事生存之道，可是确实我说的似乎他都没认真听，我所说所做的成效甚微，大概是我方法不对，还需要针对性练习把。\n我很努力的想要维持一个平衡，既不想因为说的话太重而影响母亲的心情，又想要通过温和的语言达到我心中所想的效果，每次说的时候总是想这样会不会不好？ 有没有更好更委婉的措辞？ 这样的方式实在过于内耗，妈妈和姨妈都是一类人，容易想很多的人，或许做生意的人都这样把，在这方面我也就和弟弟一样呆头呆脑。\n我努力在做一个好儿子，不过仍然还有很多需要向妻子学习的。以后要继续加油努力了，肩上的责任和担子会越来越重。希望我的孩子我能教育好，也希望他/她能成为一个有责任心，有同理心，正直，乐观，积极的人。\n","date":"2024-07-22T23:52:31+08:00","permalink":"/p/thinking-in-july/","title":"七月随感"},{"content":"推荐一波MacOS

sspai.com\n我们的世界看似雷打不动，但只要找准位置，轻轻一触，它就有可能发生倾斜。而日记，就是那个撬动世界的支点，请你务必一试。\n大多数人对日记的印象，可能还停留在小学老师对我们写日记的要求上。交差、流水账或许是大多数人对日记的看法，这导致我们以一种完成任务的心态被动记录。久而久之，大部分人没有感知到日记带来的好处，就更别提养成写日记的习惯了。\n但今天我想告诉你，写日记将会影响你的选择，重塑你的观念，甚至彻底改变你的人生，你信吗？只要按照正确的方式记日记，你的生活将发生难以置信的变化。\n我并没有在开玩笑，要解答日记为什么能发挥这么大的价值，我在此总结日记的三种作用，分别为：回顾过去，理清情绪和思维，以及做出正确选择。\n日记的作用 回顾过去 打开你的手机相册 app，大多数都自带「那年今日」的回忆功能。这个功能让我们记起去年某个时候，自己正在干什么。日记也是如此，当我们写日记时，就是为过去留下痕迹。\n频繁地回顾和翻看过去，有助于培养我们对自己人生全貌的认识。\n回看日记时，我现在还能找到 5 年前自己第一次工作时的感受，我在里面详细地记录了当时的心情、感觉，对未来的规划。\n我可以看到自己曾被什么问题困扰，又怎么解决；取得了什么成就，碰到了什么麻烦。\n辞职当天留下来的简短日记\n人生是一连串的选择组成的，当我们回看过去的内容时，我们就能知道当时的选择如何塑造了当下的我们，当一切的点滴串联成线，我们就会更好地理解自己和自己的选择，这也是苏格拉底所说「认识你自己」的第一步。\n消除恐惧，理清情绪和思考 无论是《认知觉醒》还是《晨间日记的奇迹》，都有意无意地指出了这么一个事实：\n大脑偏好消极的想法，而且会寻找各种线索来佐证它。\n如果你是个低能量的人，总是在想「我是个糟糕的家伙」，大脑就会迅速寻找相关的证据来佐证你的猜测，当恐惧和回避的情绪进入潜意识，会导致你在负面的情绪中越陷越深，甚至无法自拔。\n将自己的想法写在纸上，你就会很轻易地看到大脑是如何蛊惑你的。事实上，当你集中地把自己的想法诉诸纸上，大脑的恐吓就会瞬间失效。\n因为书写需要调用理性思维，当书写动作的优先级高于情绪，大脑皮层的语言区和书写区开始接管主体，负面情绪便会得到缓冲。\n《开放心胸》的作者杰米 · 彭尼贝克通过幸福实验也发现，运用书写来表达自己情绪的人更加健康。\n这个练习很适合那些容易内耗和自我怀疑的人，记日记可以帮你迅速出离这种状态，塑造一个更加积极和自信的自己\n做出选择 毫无疑问，如果要评选日记最大的作用，那一定是：日记可以影响我们的选择，并最终改变我们的生活。\n《习惯的力量》中有一句话为人所熟知：思想决定行为，行为决定习惯，习惯决定性格，性格决定命运。\n日记是在这之间的哪一环发生作用的？答案是思想。\n日记把我们的目光瞄向了此前一直被忽略的东西：时间和决策。看看你的日常，每一天似乎周而复始，永恒不变。可我们没有发现的是，我们总在重复错误的观念跟行为。\n你可以用这 2 个问题来验证，今天有没有比昨天更好：\n今天做了什么，有比昨天更好吗？ 今天做的事离我要达成的目标更进一步了吗？ 注意，在这一步，我们只是如实地记录自己的想法和决策而已，你不需要为此感到自责，你可以只是看看，什么也不改变也没关系。重要的是如实地记录，哪怕只是将一天的行为记录下来，接下来的行动也会有意识地发生改变，这就是日记的神奇之处。\n它会迫使你把目光转向真正重要的地方，那些原来被浪费的、被忽略的感受、情绪和行为，会在一日又一日的反思中，逐渐露出马脚。\n记录日记的方法和时间 了解日记的作用后，下一个问题自然是怎样去写日记，或者说写哪些内容。\n我将会按照从易到难的顺序，简要介绍三种记录日记的方法。这里顺带说一下记录日记的时间，很多人会建议在一天结束的时候，但以我的个人经验，这时候不仅人很疲惫，而且会很情绪化，如果还要打开电脑或手机记录自己的想法，内心一定是抵触的。\n因此我一般建议在第二天的早上把这件事做完，这个时候的大脑清醒而饱满，花 10 分钟左右的时间把日记写完，效果会比晚上好很多。\n第一个层次：记录发生的事 所有新手在记日记时都会做的一件事，就是把一天发生的事都记录下来。\n但现实中，如果真的把一天事无巨细地记录下来，恐怕三页纸都不够写的。\n在这一步，你应该有选择性地挑选那些对你来说有意义的事情。例如：\n新学的技能或是新认识的人 完成了什么成就（哪怕很小也可以，例如吃了早饭，起床早） 昨天对你影响最深刻的一件事是什么，为什么？ 有哪些事情引起了你的情绪波动 重点在于不要记流水账，而是要着重记录那些对你有触动，能引发思考的事情。\n哪怕是一件让你觉得难过 / 开心的事情，只要引起了你的情绪波动，或是让你对生活有了新的思考都可以。\n能做到这部分内容，第一个层次的记录就算完成了。\n第二个层次：记录思想跟情绪 在这个阶段，我最喜欢 3 种记录日记的方式，分别是「情绪日记」「感激日记」和「成就日记」\n情绪日记 情绪日记，就是把那些引起我们情绪波动的事情记录下来，并解释为什么会引起我们的情绪波动。\n例如你即将上台演讲，为此感到紧张和恐惧。在你的日记本中就可以这样开头：\n我现在感到惶恐不安，感到紧张、害怕，因为我即将上台参加一场很重要的演讲，如果表现差劲的话，我就要在众人面前出丑了\u0026hellip;\n如果你为一个决定感到懊悔，开头可能就是这样的：\n昨天不该在沙发上瘫坐一天，因为重要的事还没做完，最后我既没有享受到放松的愉快，也没有解决相应的问题，还给自己带来了很多无形的压力\u0026hellip;\n像这样，将内心的真实想法吐露出来，不要闷在脑海里，将你的担心和恐惧如实地写在纸上或屏幕上。\n《认知觉醒》里谈到：\n真正的困难总比想象的要小很多。人们拖延、纠结、害怕的根本原因往往不是事情本身有多难，而是内心的想法变得模糊。\n而具体事件一旦变得模糊，其边界就会无限扩大，原本并不困难的小事，也会在模糊的潜意识里变得难以解决。\n要破除这种壁障，就要揪出模糊的意识，使其变得清晰，你可以按以下 3 个问题顺序向自己提问：\n我此刻害怕的事情是什么？为什么让我感到害怕？\n关于这件事，我能做什么？\n如果没做好，最坏的结果是什么？\n无论多么难以启齿的问题，都诚实地将它反映出来，当你写在纸上后，神奇的事情就发生了——你会发现困扰自己的问题，并没有自己想象的那么严重，自己的想法也仅仅是想法而已。这股力量会迫使你的大脑冷静下来，所有恐吓的幻象便消失不见了。\n恐惧就是这样，你越逃避，它越强大；你直面恐惧，它就越弱小。\n情绪日记尤其适合那些经常否定自己，想法敏感，自我价值感低的人。它会帮助你梳理自己的情绪，并消除大多数的负面情绪，正确认识自己。\n感激日记 感激日记就是记录下那些让你感激的人和事。\n比如有一天我在感激日记中写下的内容是：\n感谢我的朋友，在关键时刻对我的接济，他们既慷慨又大方，帮我度过了最艰难的时刻。\n感谢我的恋人，我们一直关系融洽，对彼此真诚。\n感谢我的父母，支持我的选择，为我营造了心无旁骛的环境。\n感激日记会帮助我们把注意力转向积极的层面，并意识到那些被我们忽略的美好和感受。\n2017 年《幸福研究期刊》上有这样一项研究，他们招募了 91 位参与者，分为「感恩日记组」和「日常组」，前者要写下自己感恩的人或事，后者作为对照组，只记录一天做了什么。结果发现，写感恩日记组的人给自己的幸福评分更高。这背后的理论是，我们选择去关心什么事物，极大地影响了我们对生活的主观体验。\n只要试着想一想现在最让自己感到幸福和感激的事，我们就会感受到更多正面情绪，心态也更健康，把目光瞄向积极的层面，关注更多积极的层面会帮助我们把事情办好，感到更多的活力和积极情绪，形成正向循环。\n乔丹 · 彼得森在《人生十二法则》里也谈到：\n如果你抱着感恩之心看待传统、国家、日常生活中的小事和令人惊叹的成就，那么你对自我和人类的仇恨就能得到平息。\n成就日记 成就日记的概念来源于《小狗钱钱》，赚钱高手马克跟吉娅分享财富秘诀时，是这样说的：准备一个本子，叫「成功日记」，把所有做成功的事情记录进去。你最好每天都做这件事，每次都写至少 5 条你的个人成果，任何小事都可以。\n这件事对你来说也是如此，每天记录 5 件最让自己感到自豪的事情，无论什么都可以，哪怕是很小的事。\n比如我在一天记录的 5 件成就分别是：\n拒绝了 4 缺 1 的开黑请求（以前我觉得永远不可能拒绝） 无畏恐惧，去医院把痛了很久的牙齿拔了 完成了 1 个小时的阅读 用 playgrounds 编程闯过了 7、8 关 把厨房拖了一遍，干干净净 你看，我记录的事情并非是什么大成就，它们与我而言，只是一件件微不足道的小事，但随着时间的堆积，你渐渐能做到更多，并记录更多，积累很多意想不到的收获。\n刚开始时，每天就记一两件事情也足够了，重要的是形成习惯，并且常看常记。\n每天书写这样的日记，并且不时地回顾，尤其适合建立自信，发现自己的闪光点，唤起更多的自信跟动力。\n更多的自信和动力会焕发更多的积极情绪，让我们去尝试做以前那些从来不敢尝试的东西。\n第三个层次：记录自己的选择和目标 到了第 3 个层次，也是对我们影响最深的层次，我们要记录一天做下了哪些选择，并在撰写日记的过程中，尝试将自己当时的想法和情景还原出来。\n你可以写写为什么自己会做出这个决定，这个决定能够引导你过上想要的生活吗？如果不能，你应该怎么做；如果能，你觉得哪里还有提升的空间？怎样才能做得更好一些？\n特别注意平常养成的习惯，翻看日记时，你能看到相似的模式总在频繁地上演，这很好理解，预测一个人未来的最好方式就是看他过去重复的动作。\n如果你意识到这个习惯并不好，就应该想想怎么改进，以及多问自己，为什么会这样想，是不是可以换一种方法？\n在 Ali Abdaal 的视频中，他分享了自己最喜欢的一种日记组织形式：面对恐惧。在担心自己被束缚的时候，特别管用，你可以问自己以下 5 个问题：\n如果我去做了害怕的事，最糟糕的结果是什么？ 我可以做什么来防止那些坏事发生？ 如果最坏的情况发生了，我能做什么来修复它？ 如果我试过了甚至取得了小小的成功，那我会得到什么好处 如果我害怕的事情一直不做，半年、一年、三年后将会发生什么？ 这确实会让人有些压力，但仔细花 10 分钟的时间想想，却有可能彻底改变你的生活，因为当你硬着头皮把这些答案写出来时，恐惧就不再变得模糊，你会清晰地看到结果，并知道自己将承担怎样的责任，而不是逃避问题，对其视而不见。\n一个不为人知的事实是，我们其实一直都知道自己应该做什么，只不过一直在拖延而已。\n亚历克斯 · 霍尔莫兹 提出的「所罗门悖论」就是这样一种情况：所罗门王特别擅长给别人提供建议，但他自己的生活却是一团糟。\n当人们不知道他们正在讨论的是自己的情况时，他们总能给出更好的建议，如果你把自己的建议听进去了，你会过得好得多。\n试着把问题抛给 85 岁的自己，向他寻求帮助，如果是 85 岁的你，将会给出什么建议，对于现在的恐惧，又会怎么看？如果你能这样想的话，就会发现，生命中更多是无关紧要的小事，你现在担心的一切可能都没有你想象的那么严重，享受过程就好。\n写在最后 看到这里，你可能会觉得，如果每天都要把这么多日记都写一遍，那也太累了，自己根本没有时间。\n事实上，我们不需要每天都把所有的流程过一遍，只需要着重挑选那些对我们影响较大的事情，记录下来就好，每天花大约 10-15 分钟的时间就已经足够。\n随着科技和媒体的发展，关于这个世界的外部信息我们触手可及，可关于自己，却从来没有好好了解过。\n伟大的哲学家尼采说过一句很精彩的话：「一个人知道自己为什么而活，就可以忍受任何一种生活。」\n正如乔丹 · 彼得森在《人生十二法则》所说：\n你需要放眼未来，想想看如果你认真照顾自己，未来会是什么样，应该如何选择职业生涯，才能成为一个有价值、有益于社会的人。当我在有时间和精力的时候，应该如何改善我的健康，拓展我的学识，强健我的体魄，你首先需要知道自己在哪里，才能规划好之后的路线，你需要先知道自己是谁，才能平衡好自己的优缺点；你需要先知道自己想去哪里，才能控制生活的混乱程度，重建秩序。\n我们的世界看似雷打不动，但只要找准位置，轻轻一触，它就有可能发生倾斜。而日记，就是那个撬动世界的支点，请你务必一试。\n参考资料：\nAli

这个自是不必多说，首选MarkDown格式，方便各类软件编辑，关于此格式，参见wiki https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\nMarkdown是一种轻量级标记语言，创始人为约翰·格鲁伯。它允许人们使用易读易写的纯文本格式编写文档，然后转换成有效的XHTML（或者HTML）文档。[4]这种语言吸收了很多在电子邮件中已有的纯文本标记的特性。\n由于Markdown的轻量化、易读易写特性，并且对于图片，图表、数学式都有支持，目前许多网站都广泛使用Markdown来撰写帮助文档或是用于论坛上发表消息。如GitHub、Reddit、Discord、Diaspora、Stack Exchange、OpenStreetMap 、SourceForge、简书等，甚至还能被用来撰写电子书。\n笔记格式软件选择 截止2024年2月20日，比较流行的MarkDown 编辑软件有如下几个选项\n语雀 Typora VSCode Obsidian 逐个分析不选用软件的原因 语雀 语雀导入MarkDown方便，但导出功能并不是特别强大，MarkDown导入后，基本与语雀编辑器绑定，语雀官方文档上，有同学提出了希望能直接导出全知识库，但语雀团队并未提供相关支持。 原本我是语雀深度用户，团队内部使用语雀写文档，平时也是使用语雀做笔记，再配合chrome 的SimpRead 插件，方便的进行网上文章摘抄\n但2023年10月23日，语雀挂了8小时，我为此还发了朋友圈，那时候就想切换到其他笔记软件，墨迹了几个月，终于开始干这事儿了 Typora 1.0.0 之后开始收费，付费用户也可以选择此方案\nVSCode 严格来说不是专为markdown 准备的，但配合插件使用可以实现较强的功能，开源，安装插件之后也能实现很好的写作效果，但个人习惯原因，不是很喜欢此方式，还是更偏向于使用专门的编辑器来进行编辑\nObsidian 接下来Obsidian 隆重登场，Obsidian的优势\n开源 原生Markdown 编辑，就算倒闭了，或者收费了，也方便迁移到其他平台 插件市场活跃，配合Template插件，Image auto update plugin 以及Picgo 图床软件能实现不输语雀的编辑体验 配合github 的workflow ，推送完代码之后，自动构建静态博客 配合vercel 及自定义域名，代码推送到github 之后，自动部署到自己的网站
